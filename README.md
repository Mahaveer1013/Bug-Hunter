# Bug Hunter's Toolkit (BHT)

## Overview
Bug Hunter's Toolkit (BHT) is a powerful, extensible, and user-friendly tool designed to assist bug hunters and penetration testers in their manual testing efforts. BHT is not intended to automate the entire process but rather to streamline and enhance manual testing by providing essential features like form extraction, payload selection, and logic handling. The backend is built using FastAPI, while the frontend is developed with React. Additionally, BHT has plans to integrate AI capabilities to further assist in vulnerability detection and analysis.

## Key Features
- **Form Extraction**: Automatically detect and extract forms from web pages for manual testing.
- **Payload Selection**: Easily select and manage payloads for various types of vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi).
- **Logic Handling**: Simplify complex testing logic with built-in tools and workflows.
- **AI Integration** *(Planned)*: Integrate AI to assist in vulnerability detection, payload generation, and analysis.
- **Extensible Backend**: Built with FastAPI, the backend is fast, scalable, and easy to extend.
- **User-Friendly Frontend**: The React frontend provides a clean and intuitive interface for seamless interaction.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: React (JavaScript)
- **Database**: *(Optional, e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB)*
- **AI Integration** *(Planned, e.g., OpenAI, TensorFlow, or custom models)*

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Node.js (for React frontend)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahaveer1013/Bug-Hunter.git
   cd Bug-Hunter
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   The backend will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

## Usage
1. Open the React frontend in your browser: [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).
2. Use the interface to:
   - Extract forms from target URLs.
   - Select and manage payloads.
   - Apply testing logic and analyze results.
   - *(Planned)* Leverage AI-powered features for advanced vulnerability detection and analysis.

## Planned AI Integration
The AI integration will focus on:
- **Payload Generation**: Automatically generate payloads based on the context of the vulnerability.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Assist in identifying potential vulnerabilities using machine learning models.
- **Analysis and Reporting**: Provide insights and recommendations based on testing results.
